            <h3 class="">Computer and IT</h3>
            <p class="skill-desc">Since an early age, I have had a unique fascination with computers which lead me down to studying them in varsity where I did Software Engineering with multimedia, which I unfortunately dropped out of!! Either way I still continued my journey with computers until now 😉. So I can pretty much figure anything out as far as computers are concerned</p>

            <h3 class="">Python Coding</h3>
            <p class="skill-desc-right">I did java and beginner level Java Script in Varsity, which was a nightmare, but wierd enough I enjoyed it so this lead me down to python. Which I am now building on to it and believe that I am good with it👍🏼. </p>

            <h3 class="">Music Production and Djing</h3>
            <p class="skill-desc">The love for music has always been a part of my life since my early teenage years and this lead me to picking up my first FL Studio demo with which i taught myself to make music. Even though I never made it as a DJ, music became an important coping mechanism for me as a teenager and you can check out my <a href="https://soundcloud.com/utopiabwyungnation" > soundcloud and listen  </a> to my progress. And Ohh! I make😎DEEP😎HOUSE😎MUSIC!! </p>
